# Contributing

## Background

- The **app** uses `react-scripts` from Create React App
- The **package** is an npm package

## Workflow

- Ensure you have Git, Node, and Yarn installed
- Clone the `egghead-ui` repo and `cd` into it
- Create a feature branch off of `master`
- `yarn` to install latest dependencies
- `yarn dev:package` to develop the **package**
  - Use [`yarn link`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) to test using the **package** in another project
- `yarn dev:app` to develop the **app** with local dev endpoints ([egghead-rails](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-rails) needs to be running locally)
  - [localhost:2000](http://localhost:2000) to view the **app**
  - `yarn dev:app:staging` to develop the **app** with staging endpoints
  - `yarn dev:app:prod` to check the **app** with prod endpoints
- `yarn test` to run tests
- `yarn lint` to run linting
- Ensure any changed functionality in `src/package/*` is updated in the related `src/App/utils/resourcesByTypes` file(s), using faker where possible
- Stage, commit, and push
- If you want to publish a new **package** release, run `yarn bump` and type in the new version using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/); this will bump the `package.json` version and push a new git tag
- Submit a pull request for the feature branch to `master`
- Once PR status passes (approved review and successful [continuous integration in Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/eggheadio/egghead-ui), merge the pull request
- When `master` is updated
  - [Continuous deployment runs in Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/eggheadio/egghead-ui) and deploys the latest **app** to [styleguide.egghead.io](https://styleguide.egghead.io) 
  - If there was a version bump (`package.json` version and new git tag), it also publishes the new **package** version to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/egghead-ui)
    - Notify consuming projects to run `yarn upgrade egghead-ui` in their projects to get latest, with a list of changes

## Conventions

### Package management

Yarn is used for package management. Use the [yarn cli](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/usage) to add/remove/update packages which updates both the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent package installs. 

### Scripts

Yarn is used for running scripts. Use `yarn {script}` to run them. The core of the scripts extend `react-scripts` (from Create React App) so that this project doesn't have to manage compiling, linting, or testing; it generally gets all [Create React App updates](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/releases) for free by running `yarn upgrade react-scripts`. Avoid ejecting the project for this reason if at all possible.

### Components

`src` is made up primarily of **components**. A component is a directory organized _by feature_. They look like this:

```
SomeComponentName/
  index.js (entry point)
  components/ (optional sub-components)
  utils/ (optional utility modules)
```

### Screens

Some components are also **screens**. A screen is a collection of components that form a "page"; it is generally a collection of `Card`s. They look like this:

```
SomeScreenName/
  index.js (entry point)
  screens/ (optional sub-screens paired with sub-routes)
  components/ (optional sub-components)
  utils/ (optional utility modules)
```

### Endpoints

The `Request` component is used for making requests to endpoints. Hypermedia properties (`*_url`) should be used for all URLs in `package/*` resources; this ensures endpoint permissions and environment.

### Paths

ES2015 modules are used for sharing code between files. Both `NODE_PATH` (for the **app**) and `babel-plugin-module-resolver` (for the **package**) are set to `src` so `import Icon from 'package/components/Icon'` will grab `src/package/components/Icon`. When trying to decide if an import should use an absolute or relative path, it depends on the situation: if something belongs to an inner module/component, it should reference the pieces relatively; if something is using a general promoted module/component, it should import the pieces absolutely. A good rule of thumb is to keep everything relative that would be moved together so it is self-contained.

### Promotion

All resources are eligible for **promotion** to facilitate code reuse. If a resource is shared by multiple files the principle of [lowest common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) applies and that shared resource is _promoted_ to the lowest common ancestorâ€™s directory.

### JavaScript

Latest JS syntax is used where it makes sense. [Lodash](lodash.com) methods are often used in place of native methods for performance, convenience, and consistency.

### Styles

The root egghead-ui components are used wherever possible. Styling is largely taken care of by these components. When app specific styles are needed beyond that, `tachyons-egghead` classes are used where possible. Styles are added to work on mobile first based on the container size (using flex wrap with flex values or max width, or `<ContainerWidth>`). When more customization is needed, `styled-components` is used.

### Linting

Linting is currently provided by `react-scripts` (ESLint).

### Testing

Testing is currently provided by `react-scripts` (Jest). Files that could benefit from tests have an `index.test.js` file next to them. These are generally simple unit or snapshot tests where they provide value.
